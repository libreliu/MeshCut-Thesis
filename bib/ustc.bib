abstract = {Surface geometry is often modeled with irregular triangle meshes. The process of remeshing refers to approximating such geometry using a mesh with (semi)-regular connectivity, which has advantages for many graphics applications. However, current techniques for remeshing arbitrary surfaces create only semi-regular meshes. The original mesh is typically decomposed into a set of disk-like charts, onto which the geometry is parametrized and sampled. In this paper, we propose to remesh an arbitrary surface onto a completely regular structure we call a geometry image. It captures geometry as a simple 2D array of quantized points. Surface signals like normals and colors are stored in similar 2D arrays using the same implicit surface parametrization - - texture coordinates are absent. To create a geometry image, we cut an arbitrary mesh along a network of edge paths, and parametrize the resulting single chart onto a square. Geometry images can be encoded using traditional image compression algorithms, such as wavelet-based coders. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract = {Parameterization of discrete surfaces is a fundamental and widely-used operation in graphics, required, for instance, for texture mapping or remeshing. As 3D data becomes more and more detailed, there is an increased need for fast and robust techniques to automatically compute least-distorted parameterizations of large meshes. In this paper, we present new theoretical and practical results on the parameterization of triangulated surface patches. Given a few desirable properties such as rotation and translation invariance, we show that the only admissible parameterizations form a two-dimensional set and each parameterization in this set can be computed using a simple, sparse, linear system. Since these parameterizations minimize the distortion of different intrinsic measures of the original mesh, we call them Intrinsic Parameterizations. In addition to this partial theoretical analysis, we propose robust, efficient and tunable tools to obtain least-distorted parameterizations automatically. In particular, we give details on a novel, fast technique to provide an optimal mapping without fixing the boundary positions, thus providing a unique Natural Intrinsic Parameterization. Other techniques based on this parameterization family, designed to ease the rapid design of parameterizations, are also proposed.},

@article{Li2018,
abstract = {Low-distortion mapping of three-dimensional surfaces to the plane is a critical problem in geometry processing. The intrinsic distortion introduced by these UV mappings is highly dependent on the choice of surface cuts that form seamlines which break mapping continuity. Parameterization applications typically require UV maps with an application-specic upper bound on distortion to avoid mapping artifacts; at the same time they seek to reduce cut lengths to minimize discontinuity artifacts. We propose OptCuts, an algorithm that jointly optimizes the parameterization and cutting of a three-dimensional mesh. OptCuts starts from an arbitrary initial embedding and a user-requested distortion bound. It requires no parameter setting and automatically seeks to minimize seam lengths subject to satisfying the distortion bound of the mapping computed using these seams. OptCuts alternates between topology and geometry update steps that consistently decrease distortion and seam length, producing a UV map with compact boundaries that strictly satises the distortion bound. OptCuts automatically produces high-quality, globally bijective UV maps without user intervention. While OptCuts can thus be a highly eective tool to create new mappings from scratch, we also show how it can be employed to improve pre-existing embeddings. Additionally, when semantic or other priors on seam placement are desired, OptCuts can be extended to respect these user preferences as constraints during optimization of the parameterization. We demonstrate the scalable performance of OptCuts on a wide range of challenging benchmark parameterization examples, as well as in comparisons with state-of-the-art UV methods and commercial tools.},

A reduced polygonal schema Q of optimal size is computed from P, where a surjective map from the vertices of P is retained to the vertices of Q. This helps detecting null-homotopic (contractible to a point) cycles. Given a cycle of length k, we determine if it is null-homotopic in O(n+k log g) time and in $\theta$(n+k) space, where g is the genus of the given 2-manifold.

We show that we can compute a basis H of and annotate each p-simplex of with a binary vector of length g with the following property: the annotations, summed over all p-simplices in any p-cycle z, provide the coordinate vector of the homology class [z] in the basis H. The basis and the annotations for all simplices can be computed in O(n $\omega$ ) time, where n is the size of and $\omega$ < 2.376 is a quantity so that two n×n matrices can be multiplied in O(n $\omega$ ) time. The precomputed annotations permit answering queries about the independence or the triviality of p-cycles efficiently. Using annotations of edges in 2-complexes, we derive better algorithms for computing optimal basis and optimal homologous cycles in 1 - dimensional homology. Specifically, for computing an optimal basis of , we improve the previously known time complexity from O(n 4) to O(n $\omega$ + n 2 g $\omega$ - 1).

Central to this method is the use of the axis-aligned structure that converts the general polygon packing problem to a rectangle packing problem, which is easier to achieve high packing efficiency. Given a parameterized mesh with no flipped triangles, we propose a new angle-driven deformation strategy to transform it into a set of axis-aligned charts, which can be decomposed into rectangles by the motorcycle graph algorithm. Since motorcycle graphs are not unique, we select the one balancing the trade-off between the packing efficiency and chart boundary length, while maintaining bounded packing efficiency. The axis-aligned chart often contains greater distortion than the input, so we try to reduce the distortion while bounding the packing efficiency and retaining bijection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a data set containing over five thousand complex models. For all models, our method is able to produce packed atlases with bounded packing efficiency; for example, when the packing efficiency bound is set to 80%, we elongate the boundary length by an average of 78.7% and increase the distortion by an average of 0.0533%. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method is much faster and achieves greater packing efficiency.},

The resulting disk may be viewed as a polygon in which the sides are pairwise identified on the surface; it is called a polygonal schema. Assuming that M is a combinatorial surface, and that each edge has a given length, we are interested in a shortest (or optimal) system of loops homotopic to a given one, drawn on the vertex-edge graph of M. We prove that each loop of such an optimal system is a shortest loop among all simple loops in its homotopy class. We give an algorithm to build such a system, which has polynomial running time if the lengths of the edges are uniform. As a byproduct, we get an algorithm with the same running time to compute a shortest simple loop homotopic to a given simple loop. {\textcopyright} 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.},

Based on the observation that conformal spherical and planar parameterizations have similar distortion distributions at the extrusive areas that lead to high isometric distortions, our method utilizes a spherical parameterization of the input mesh to guide the cut construction. After parameterizing the input mesh onto a sphere as conformal as possible, a hierarchical clustering of the divisive type is conducted on the sphere to find high isometric distortion regions, where high isometric distortion may also be introduced in the planar parameterization and which are connected to define a cut. Compared with previous methods, this approach can generate better cuts, resulting in lower isometric distortions.

abstract = {A special family of non-trivial loops on a surface called handle and tunnel loops associates closely to geometric features of "handles" and "tunnels" respectively in a 3D model. The identification of these handle and tunnel loops can benefit a broad range of applications from topology simplification / repair, and surface parameterization, to feature and shape recognition. Many of the existing efficient algorithms for computing non-trivial loops cannot be used to compute these special type of loops. The two algorithms known for computing handle and tunnel loops provably have a serious drawback that they both require a tessellation of the interior and exterior spaces bounded by the surface. Computing such a tessellation of three dimensional space around the surface is a non-trivial task and can be quite expensive. Furthermore, such a tessellation may need to refine the surface mesh, thus causing the undesirable side-effect of outputting the loops on an altered surface mesh. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute a basis for handle and tunnel loops without requiring any 3D tessellation. This saves time considerably for large meshes making the algorithm scalable while computing the loops on the original input mesh and not on some refined version of it. We use the concept of the Reeb graph which together with several key theoretical insights on linking number provide an initial set of loops that provably constitute a handle and a tunnel basis. We further develop a novel strategy to tighten these handle and tunnel basis loops to make them geometrically relevant. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm as well as show its robustness against noise, and other anomalies in the input. Copyright {\textcopyright} ACM 2013.},
