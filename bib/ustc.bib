abstract = {Surface geometry is often modeled with irregular triangle meshes. The process of remeshing refers to approximating such geometry using a mesh with (semi)-regular connectivity, which has advantages for many graphics applications. However, current techniques for remeshing arbitrary surfaces create only semi-regular meshes. The original mesh is typically decomposed into a set of disk-like charts, onto which the geometry is parametrized and sampled. In this paper, we propose to remesh an arbitrary surface onto a completely regular structure we call a geometry image. It captures geometry as a simple 2D array of quantized points. Surface signals like normals and colors are stored in similar 2D arrays using the same implicit surface parametrization - - texture coordinates are absent. To create a geometry image, we cut an arbitrary mesh along a network of edge paths, and parametrize the resulting single chart onto a square. Geometry images can be encoded using traditional image compression algorithms, such as wavelet-based coders. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of cutting a set of edges on a poly-hedral manifold surface, possibly with boundary, to obtain a single topological disk, minimizing either the total number of cut edges or their total length. We show that this problem is NP-hard, even for manifolds without boundary and for punctured spheres. We also describe an algorithm with running time nO(g+k), where n is the combinatorial complexity, g is the genus, and k is the number of boundary components of the input surface. Finally, we describe a greedy algorithm that outputs a O(log2 g)-approximation of the minimum cut graph in O(g2n log n) time.},

abstract = {We provide a new technique for deriving optimal-sized polygonal schema for triangulated compact 2-manifolds without boundary in O(n) time, where n is the size of the given triangulation T. We first derive a polygonal schema P embedded in T using Seifert-Van Kampen's theorem. A reduced polygonal schema Q of optimal size is computed from P, where a surjective map from the vertices of P is retained to the vertices of Q. This helps detecting null-homotopic (contractible to a point) cycles. Given a cycle of length k, we determine if it is null-homotopic in O(n+k log g) time and in $\theta$(n+k) space, where g is the genus of the given 2-manifold. The actual contraction for a null-homotopic cycle can be computed in $\theta$(nk) time and space. This is a considerable improvement over the previous best-known algorithm for this problem. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {Let be a simplicial complex and g the rank of its p-th homology group defined with ℤ 2 coefficients. We show that we can compute a basis H of and annotate each p-simplex of with a binary vector of length g with the following property: the annotations, summed over all p-simplices in any p-cycle z, provide the coordinate vector of the homology class [z] in the basis H. The basis and the annotations for all simplices can be computed in O(n $\omega$ ) time, where n is the size of and $\omega$ < 2.376 is a quantity so that two n×n matrices can be multiplied in O(n $\omega$ ) time. The precomputed annotations permit answering queries about the independence or the triviality of p-cycles efficiently. Using annotations of edges in 2-complexes, we derive better algorithms for computing optimal basis and optimal homologous cycles in 1 - dimensional homology. Specifically, for computing an optimal basis of , we improve the previously known time complexity from O(n 4) to O(n $\omega$ + n 2 g $\omega$ - 1). Here n denotes the size of the 2-skeleton of and g the rank of . Computing an optimal cycle homologous to a given 1-cycle is NP-hard even for surfaces and an algorithm taking 2 O(g) nlogn time is known for surfaces. We extend this algorithm to work with arbitrary 2-complexes in O(n $\omega$ ) + 2 O(g) n 2logn time using annotations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},
